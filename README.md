###  Project Background

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete **two** Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

### PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called `budget_data.csv`. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called `election_data.csv`. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
